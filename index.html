            <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. 
            Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. 
            A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. 
            It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. </p>
            
            <p>Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life.
            One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. 
            The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. 
            She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>

            <p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. 
                For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. 
                The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. 
                Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. </p>

            <p>To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. 
                If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. 
                The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. 
                It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. 
                To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is.</p>
